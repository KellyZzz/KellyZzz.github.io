<h2>Kelly Zhang - User Interaction Software - FALL 2017</h2>

<p>UI / UX is not just about HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT</p>

<p>It is extremely important to do the user researches and user testings to see if the project works well for users or not. </p>

<p>The user researches gave the idea for how to start the project and start from where. </p>

<p>The user testings gave the idea for where I should edit and what is not appropriate. </p>

<p>When I code for me website, I never thought that some functions will make the users feel uncomfortable, but the truth is yes, it does.</p>

<p>I learned the frontend coding part from W3, Stack Overflow and codyAcademy, but what INF133 taught me is how to be a designer.</p>

<button class="accordion">Summary of Findings</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I never thought that there are that much problems from my midterm project. When I did the midterm project. Me and my roommates are the only users of my websites, so I did not really let other people use my websites and the functions on it. The User Research helps me a lot for starting the project. The User testing and the comments for midterm project helps me a lot for editing my website from the midterm to the final.</p>

  <p>I looked deep into all of my user researches. I can tell that people from different areas have different kinds of request when they look into the website. I will take their advice and mainly focus on the advice that came from HR and people who already got offer from the desired field that I am willing to join in the future. It will be more helpful.</p>

  <p>From the user testing part, I got more next step advice. For the basic technical part, there are several problems on different page. For the first page, which is the welcome page, my users are more than willing to click on my name, which is not clickable based on my design. For the second page, which was the about page, some of my friends told me that the design looks a little bit messy, so it will be better to make it more clear. Also, people cannot find the Life Blog button to click if I put them at the end of my personal introduction. For the third page, which is the career part, muy users do not provide a lot of detailed advice, but I felt that do not have a downloadable resume might become a problem at this point. For the last page, which is the contact page, some people suggest me to put a button to jump to mailbox, some people say no. Also, the grader of my midterm project gave me the advice to put a mailto link to the email address</p>

  <p>There are several important things that I learned from the project.</p>

  <p>Recognition rather than recall. Minimize cognitive load by maintaining task-relevant information within the display while users explore the interface. Human attention is limited and we are only capable of maintaining around five items in our short-term memory at one time. Due to the limitations of short-term memory, designers should ensure users can simply employ recognition instead of recalling information across parts of the dialogue. Recognizing something is always easier than recall because recognition involves perceiving cues that help us reach into our vast memory and allowing relevant information to surface. For example, we often find the format of multiple choice questions easier than short answer questions on a test because it only requires us to recognize the answer rather than recall it from our memory.</p>

  <p>Consistency and standards. Interface designers should ensure that both the graphic elements and terminology are maintained across similar platforms. For example, an icon that represents one category or concept should not represent a different concept when used on a different screen.</p>

  <p>Help and documentation. Ideally, we want users to navigate the system without having to resort to documentation. However, depending on the type of solution, documentation may be necessary. When users require help, ensure it is easily located, specific to the task at hand and worded in a way that will guide them through the necessary steps towards a solution to the issue they are facing.</p>

<button class="accordion">Incorporation of Findings</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Based on the findings and several detail thing I provided in the previous section, I solved most of the problems and still doing research on some other topics. The website is the first frontend project I did. I found the interest from it and will revamp it during winter break. I believe that User Interface and User Experience is not just about code. We need to be really user friendly to make it work.</p>

  <p>Several things that I changed from midterm. For the first page, my name is clickable. As what the professor mentioned in the lecture that the important of image choosing, the cat I use on my home page brings my users' attention to click on my name. I add a second page, which is the current page as the research page to show what I did for the project. For the third page, I re-design the color part of my personal introduction and move the life blog link to a more noticable place. On the fourth page, I put a resume on the career page and it can be downloaded by clicking the link. On the last page, which is the contact page, I make the email clickable and it could directly bring my users to their mailbox. I didnot hide the email address, which is helpful forthe people who like to use the website version of email. I also change some media query code for the page in order to make it fit in more device.</p>

  <p>
  	I never thought that I could be a UI/UX designer before. However, I found my interest from the class. Although my code looks immatured, I still try to make those things on the right position. What I did this quarter is just the beginning. I will try to learn more on the user interface, user interaction and user experience field.
