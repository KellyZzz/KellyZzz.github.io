<h2>Kelly Zhang - User Interaction Software - FALL 2017</h2>

<p>
	UI / UX is not just about HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT
</p>

<p>
	It is extremely important to do the user research and user testing if you are doing a project that realted to users. 
</p>

<p>I have the deep feeling on the point after I went through all the parts of the project sections this quarter. When I code for me website, I never thought that some functions will make the users feel uncomfortable, but the truth is yes, it does.
</p>

<p>
	 That is the reason why we need to do all the research and testing to make sure the project actually work well.

<button class="accordion">Summary of Findings</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I never thought that there are that much problems from my midterm project. When I did the midterm project. Me and my roommates are the only users of my websites, so I did not really let other people use my websites and the functions on it. The user testing and the cognitive walkthrough helps me a lot from the midterm to final.</p>

  <p>For the basic technical part, there are several problems on different page. For the first page, which is the welcome page, my users are more than willing to click on my name, which is not clickable based on my design. For the second page, which was the about page, some of my friends told me that the design looks a little bit messy, so it will be better to make it more clear. For the third page, which is the career part, muy users do not provide a lot of detailed advice, but I felt that do not have a downloadable resume might become a problem at this point. For the last page, which is the contact page, some people suggest me to put a button to jump to mailbox, some people say no. I will think about it and make the decission</p>

  <p>In a nut shell, there are design problems, user experience problems and function problems in my portfolio website. I looked deep into all of my user research, I can tell that people from different areas have different kinds of request when they look into the website. I will take their advice and mainly focus on the advice that came from HR and people who already got offer from the desired field that I am willing to join in the future. It will be more helpful.</p>

  <p>Recognition rather than recall. Minimize cognitive load by maintaining task-relevant information within the display while users explore the interface. Human attention is limited and we are only capable of maintaining around five items in our short-term memory at one time. Due to the limitations of short-term memory, designers should ensure users can simply employ recognition instead of recalling information across parts of the dialogue. Recognizing something is always easier than recall because recognition involves perceiving cues that help us reach into our vast memory and allowing relevant information to surface. For example, we often find the format of multiple choice questions easier than short answer questions on a test because it only requires us to recognize the answer rather than recall it from our memory.</p>

  <p>Consistency and standards. Interface designers should ensure that both the graphic elements and terminology are maintained across similar platforms. For example, an icon that represents one category or concept should not represent a different concept when used on a different screen.</p>

  <p>Help and documentation. Ideally, we want users to navigate the system without having to resort to documentation. However, depending on the type of solution, documentation may be necessary. When users require help, ensure it is easily located, specific to the task at hand and worded in a way that will guide them through the necessary steps towards a solution to the issue they are facing.</p>

<button class="accordion">Incorporation of Findings</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Based on the findings and several detail thing I provided in the previous section, I solve most of the problems and still doing research on some other topics. I believe that User Interface and User Experience is not just about code. We need to be really user friendly to make it work.</p>

  <p>Several things that I changed from midterm. I add a head and a footer for each page. Also, I put a resume on the career page and it can be downloaded by clicking the link. Additionally, some design features thing are added into each pages in order to make it looks good. I also change some media query code for the page in order to make it fit in more device.</p>

  <p>I'm still thinking about how to change on the last page, which is the contact page. Some people told me that it will not be helpful at all if the click will directly jump to their desktop mailbox. Some others provide me totally different ideas. I thought about put both options on the page, but it looks so stupid for doing the doubling thing, so I still keep my original design.</p>
